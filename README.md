# Don't Be Stationary - Unreal Engine 5 Game

## Project Overview
Welcome to **Don't Be Stationary**, an exciting game developed using Unreal Engine 5. In this unique experience, you embody a paper plane living on a sheet of paper, threatened by real-life objects aiming to tear you away. Navigate through a hostile environment, avoiding tears and combating enemies to survive as long as possible. The game incorporates innovative mechanics, such as time manipulation, to enhance your survival strategies.

## Collaboration Plan
Our team collaborated effectively to bring this project to life. We utilized version control on GitHub for code collaboration, while project files were regularly uploaded to a shared drive to maintain consistency. Roles were distributed with a focus on each member's strengths â€“ graphic design, quality control, programming, and specific gameplay elements.

## Milestones and Achievements
For our initial goals, we successfully achieved the following milestones:
- Implemented movable player character with enemy interaction.
- Created a general enemy class and projectile class.
- Developed the first enemy for testing.
- Added a basic player attack.
- Implemented a time mechanic to slow down the game.
